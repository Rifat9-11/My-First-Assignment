                        the people for giving your total support to them. Let us make the best use of our new victory.
                        Let
                        us
                        not let this slip away because of our mistakes. I fervently appeal to everybody to stay calm.
                        Please
                        refrain from all kinds of violence. I appeal to all students, members of all political parties
                        and
                        non-political people to stay calm. This is our beautiful country with lots of exciting
                        possibilities. We
                        must protect and make it a wonderful country for us and for our future generations.
                        Our youth is ready to give this leadership in creating a new world. Let us not miss the chance
                        by
                        going
                        into any senseless violence. Violence is our enemy. Please don’t create more enemies. Be calm
                        and
                        get
                        ready to build the country.
                        If we take the path of violence everything will be destroyed. Please stay calm. Help those
                        around
                        you to
